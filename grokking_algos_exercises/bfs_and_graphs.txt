d#bfs finds shortest distance between two things
#although graphs can be used to represent all kinds
#of things one thing they can be used to represent #are different routes between two locations(think Google maps)

#the "breadth-first search" algorithm can solve the 
#shortest-path problem. The shortest-path problem #can find the shortest route between two points. In
#a graph made u of nodes there is paths between 
#them called edges and the bfs would find 
#the path between two nodes with the least edges

#"graphs model sets of connections" (pg. 98)
#"graphs are made up of nodes and edges" (pg. 99)
#"graphs model how different things are connected to one another"(pg. 99)

#BFS is a search algorithm that runs on graphs
#it helps answer two types of questions
	#is there a path from node A to node B?
	#what is shortest path from node A to node B?
#ex.
#I'm a mango seller. I have friends on Facebook that I want to know if whether they are mango sellers. If I don't directly 
have friends that sell mangos I want to find out if THEIR friends sell mangos. If I have a list of my friends I want to search through, I add their friends if they themselves don't sell mangos. If my friends dont sell mangoes and neither do their friends I find out if their friends(friends of friends) do and on and on.  My friends are considered first degree connections and their friends are considered second degree connections. What would their friends be considered to me? THIRD degree connections. 
#First degree connections are added to list before second-degree connections. (When do friends get on list?)
#people are searched in the order they are added.
#QUEUES
#queues are like lines you wait on at places like stores and also exhibit the behavior of them; the first people in line are the first people to get served. Queues only have two operations which are "enqueue" and "dequeue". "enqueue" adds to back of line and "dequeue" takes front of line off. queues are called "FIFO" data structures.

#I. Implementing graph
	# A. Graphs consist of several nodes
		#1. nodes is connected to neighboring nodes
		#note: hash tables can express a relationship between nodes. hash tables allow the mapping of keys to a value.
		#example in code:
			graph = {}
			graph["you"] = ["alice","bob","claire"]
 
	#B. Graphs are just a bunch of nodes and edges
	#C. a directed graph is a graph where nodes only have a one directional relationship with other nodes. (i don't know
if all nodes have to have that condition)
		#1. A<----->B (directed)
		#2. A------B (undirected)
BFS example:
from collections import deque

graph = dict()#same as graph = {}
graph["david(me)"] = ["alisom", "claire", "Bob"]#my friends
graph["bob"] = ["anuj", "peggy"]
graph["alice"] = ["peggy"]
#print("graph: ", graph)

#print("search_queue: ", search_queue)
#deque(['steve', 'david', 'Jesus'])

def person_is_seller(name): #checks to see if persons name ends with the letter m and if it does they sell mango
#this is a way to see if someone sells mangos
  return name[-1] == 'm'

def search(name):
    search_queue = deque()#creates new queue
    search_queue += graph[name]#adds neighbors to search queue
    while search_queue: #while queue is not empty
        person = search_queue.popleft()#grabs 1st person off queue
        print("person: ", person, "| search_queue: ", search_queue)
        if person_is_seller(person) == True: #does person sell mangos?
            print(person, " is a mango seller!")            
        else:
            if person in graph:#does person have friends to add to search_queue?
                search_queue += graph[person]#add person's friend to queue
            else:
                print(person, " not in search_queue")
            
search("david(me)")
