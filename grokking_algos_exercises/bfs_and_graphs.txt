#bfs finds shortest distance between two things
#although graphs can be used to represent all kinds
#of things one thing they can be used to represent #are different routes between two locations(think Google maps)

#the "breadth-first search" algorithm can solve the 
#shortest-path problem. The shortest-path problem #can find the shortest route between two points. In
#a graph made u of nodes there is paths between 
#them called edges and the bfs would find 
#the path between two nodes with the least edges

#"graphs model sets of connections" (pg. 98)
#"graphs are made up of nodes and edges" (pg. 99)
#"graphs model how different things are connected to one another"(pg. 99)
